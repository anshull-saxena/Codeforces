## 📊 Problem Statistics

This repository contains solutions organized by problem difficulty and contest type.

---

## 📁 Repository Structure

The repository is organized in two main ways:

### 1. By Problem Difficulty
Problems are categorized by their typical Codeforces difficulty levels:

```
├── A/                    # Div2 A problems (easier)
│   ├── A_Bit.cpp
│   ├── A_Boys_and_Girls.cpp
│   ├── A_Comparing_Strings.cpp
│   ├── A_Dima_and_Friends.cpp
│   ├── A_Forked.cpp
│   ├── A_Pythagorean_Theorem_II.cpp
│   └── A_Red_Versus_Blue.cpp
├── B/                    # Div2 B problems (medium)
│   ├── B_Basketball_Together.cpp
│   ├── B_Calendar.cpp
│   ├── B_Chemistry.cpp
│   ├── B_Increase_and_Decrease.cpp
│   ├── B_Interesting_drink.cpp
│   └── B_Luke_is_a_Foodie.cpp
├── C/                    # Div2 C problems (harder)
│   └── C_Lucky_Permutation_Triple.cpp
├── D/                    # Div2 D problems (advanced)
│   └── D_Rectangle_Puzzle_II.cpp
├── E/                    # Div2 E problems (expert)
├── F/                    # Div2 F problems (master)
└── ...
```

### 2. By Contest
Specific contest solutions are organized by contest number:

```
├── Contests/
│   ├── Contest_304/
│   │   ├── A_Pythagorean_Theorem_II.cpp
│   │   ├── B_Calendar.cpp
│   │   └── C_Lucky_Permutation_Triple.cpp
│   └── ...
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

To explore the solutions:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anshull-saxena/Codeforces.git
   ```

2. Navigate to problems by difficulty:
   ```bash
   cd Codeforces/A    # For A-level problems
   cd Codeforces/B    # For B-level problems
   ```

3. Or browse specific contests:
   ```bash
   cd Codeforces/Contests/Contest_304
   ```

4. Compile and run any solution:
   ```bash
   g++ -o solution A_Problem_Name.cpp
   ./solution
   ```

## 💡 Problem Solving Approach

Each solution includes:
- Clean, well-commented C++ code
- Efficient algorithms optimized for competitive programming
- Standard template library (STL) usage
- Time and space complexity considerations

---

## 🔧 Code Template

Most solutions use a standard competitive programming template:

```cpp
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
#define ll long long int
#define pb push_back
#define vi vector<int>
#define vll vector<ll>
#define fo(i, n) for (long long i = 0; i < n; i++)
// Problem-specific solution code
```
